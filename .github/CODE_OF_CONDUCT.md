# MeerK40t Code of Conduct

This page is provided to set expectations about how all contributors, big or small,
to the MeerK40t project are expected to behave towards one another and to the project as a whole.

It is based on, and is a simplified version of,
the [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct v2.1](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct/).

## Overview

We want the MeerK40t project to be an open and welcoming environment.
We expect contributors to make participation a harassment-free experience for everyone,
regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity,
sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience,
education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance,
race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behaviour that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting the majority view or @Tatarize's overarching veto even if you disagree with it
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience
* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community

Examples of unacceptable behaviour by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and sexual attention or advances of any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
* Attempting to add malicious or inappropriate code to the codebase
* Use of unacceptable language in code, online comments, wiki pages etc.
* Any other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate

## Our Responsibilities

@Tatarize and deputised contributors (MeerKittens) may take appropriate and fair corrective action
in response to any instances of unacceptable behaviour, including removing, editing, or rejecting comments,
commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct,
or in the case of extreme or persistent to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor
for other behaviours that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

In the event of an appeal by the contributor, the ultimate arbiter will be @Tatarize whose decision will be final.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public
spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community.
Examples of representing a project or community include using an
official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account
or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.
Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by @Tatarize.

## Flagging concerns

Instances of abusive, harassing or otherwise unacceptable behaviour may be
reported by contacting @Tatarize via Github, Discord or irc.
