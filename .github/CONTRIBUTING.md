## Pull Requests

Code improvements and language improvements need to be submitted as Push Requests.
Usually you will need to fork the
[MeerK40t/MeerK40t repo](/meerk40t/meerk40t),
then use Git to clone your fork to your computer,
create a new Git branch for your changes,
code and test your changes,
use Git to push them up to Github,
and then create a Github Push Request.
If you are not a Git expert (and how many of us are?),
you may want to install Github Desktop to make this easy for you.

When you are submitting a Pull Request:

1. Please feel free to submit incomplete changes if you want early feedback.
Please mark such submissions as **Draft** until they are ready for formal review.
2. Where appropriate add new Unit Tests.
Please ensure that both existing and new Unit Tests run cleanly when you have finished coding.
