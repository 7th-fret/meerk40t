# Legacy

Legacy are items that are being removed but for whom ripping them out of the system whole-cloth will be too violent and break things. This is started in 0.8.0 for the old style drivers.

0.7.x driver system was a connection between `spooler -> controller -> output` and these could be mixed and  matched. However this proved to be too unruly and functionally broken. Rather than removing the device methods it became the legacy device, at least during the transition over to modern Services based devices.
