# Device

Device modules are specific to laser cutting and the lower level interactions with laser cutter drivers. This includes the USB connections and connections to the CH341-chip through both the libUSB driver (`pyusb`) as well as any networked connections with laser-cutters.

This includes mock devices that are emulated for the purposes of compatibility or research.
