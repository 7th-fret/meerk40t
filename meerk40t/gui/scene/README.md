# Scene

The scene provide for the interactions within visual space of dynamically drawn widgets. The widgets work independently of each other and can control their hit boxes, deal with events and draw themselves and other values.

This is similar to other widget/scene UI visual libraries and includes affine transformations, hit chaining, and context specific interactions. It is intended to work correctly with wxPython drawing spaces and provides a ScenePanel to be drawn upon.
