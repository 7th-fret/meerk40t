# Balor

BalorMK is the meerk40t plugin-driver for Balor by Bryce Schroeder which controls the LMC ezcad2 galvo laser boards.


# Licensing

This like everything in MeerK40t is MIT, however Balor itself is GPL licenced and should be slated for eventual spinning off again as a proper plugin. During the testing phase for 0.8.x this was included into MeerK40t proper to facilitate easier development.
