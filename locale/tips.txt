tip=MeerK40ts standard to load / save data is the svg-Format (supported by many tools like inkscape).\nWhile it is supporting most of SVG functionalities, there are still some unsupported features (most notably advanced text effect, clips and gradients).\nTo overcome that limitation MeerK40t can automatically convert these features with the help of inkscape:\njust set the 'Unsupported feature' option in the preference section to 'Ask at load time'
